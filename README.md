# Pervasive Code's Java Measurement Utilities for JSR 363

This library includes classes for using the [JSR 363 Units of Measurement API](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=363) with measurements of amount of data and rate of data.

The JSR 363 API specification provides for a type-safe Java representation of quantities with units.

This library depends on the [Units of Measurement](https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement) GitHub project and its [Units of Measurement Systems](https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/uom-systems) and [JSR 363 Implementation for Java SE 8](https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/uom-se).

This library provides bytes-per-second and bits-per-second unit types, and code to format quantities using these types in familiar formats, such as "300 GB" (SI prefixes) or "1.4 KiB" (IEC binary prefixes).


## Overview of included classes

Javadocs are available on `javadoc.io`:

See the separate [OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md) file for a description of what interfaces and classes are included. (Overview content is taken from class Javadoc comments, so there's no need to read both.)

## How to use it in your code

See the [Example Code](OVERVIEW.md#example-code) section in [OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md) for details.


## Including it in your project
